Multiplayer implementation of a card game I created with a friend at MOP 23

Not production ready. Functions properly except for the incomplete UI—you can emit events through console. Unfinished because unfortunately we don't play the game anymore—maybe someday!

Built using Socket.IO, React/JSX, compiled with Babel and Browserify.
